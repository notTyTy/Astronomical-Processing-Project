## Astronomical Processing 
This is a multi-themed, multi-language Windows Form application that takes advantage of net-pipe to complete calculations for the front-end. The goal of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of Windows Forms, and my ability to create an application that could be used internationally, with custom theming depending on the user requirements. net-pipe socket is started via a console application, ensuring the server is not always running on the host.
